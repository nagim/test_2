== Block Elements

Code examples, commands, user input and output are rendered with monospaced font and grey backround in a distinct block.

Highlighted parts in code examples are written with colored text.

Code example:

tsp_IMS_Configuration_Scenarios.trafficCases.trafficSpecific.media :=
          {
            enabled := true,

|Flag |Type |Description
|`-n` |mandatory* a|Number of IP addresses

> ==== Note::Note
>
> The following three options need to be set together for this mode:
>
> `-net`, `–mask` or `–dev`

|`-anyIP` |mandatory* a|This flag indicates the `AnyIP` mode. `AnyIP` is the capability to receive packets and establish incoming connections on IPs that have not been explicitly configured on the machine.

* `-net` and `-mask` must be set.
* `-n` and `-dev` must NOT be set.

|`-net` |optional a|
Network address for virtual IPs

> ==== Note::Note
>
> The first virtual IP is the net address + 1.

Example:
[source]
net address: 192.168.0.0
first virtual ip: 192.168.0.1

Example:
[source]
net address: 2001:1b70:8294:0800::1
first virtual ip: 2001:1b70:8294:0800::2

|`-mask`               |optional a|Network mask for virtual IPs CIDR, link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632[RFC 4632] (network bits count for example: _``18``_ or _``24``_).          
|`-dev` |optional |Device to use, for example `eth1`
|`-dry`                |optional |It makes the script to only print the commands for adding or deleting the virtual IP addresses. This gives a possibility to check the addresses being added/removed.
|`-ipv`                |optional |IP version, 4 or 6 (Default: 4)
|`-help\|h`             |optional |Prints the help of the available options.
